## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- rem units
- Mobile-first design

### What I learned

I learned how to make a fluid and scalable layout by using `rem` units. It helped me better understand how flexible sizing works in CSS and why it's important for consistency and accessibility.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to improve the **responsiveness** of my designs and focus more on creating a clean, well-structured codebase. I also plan to explore more layout techniques and possibly use media queries more effectively.
